##Introduction
Travel Run is a platform built to bridge the gap between local businesses and travel agents.
- Business can promote their services on the platform
- Travel agents can browse through the list of these local businesses and hence make good packages for their customers

Benefit of Local Businesses - 
- They can promote their business and get customers through travel agents at a very nominal fee.

Benefit of Travel Agents - 
- They can discover ‘hidden gems’ on our platform and thus make their packages much better
- They get points on bringing customers to the business and this is done via a verification code.
- They also get points when they bring a local business to the platform using their unique referral code.


- This platform not only empowers travel agents with a broader network of businesses but also serves as a catalyst for promoting local enterprises. 
- By encouraging travelers to immerse themselves in the local culture and experience a myriad of activities, our project aims to foster a deeper connection between tourists and the destinations they visit.
